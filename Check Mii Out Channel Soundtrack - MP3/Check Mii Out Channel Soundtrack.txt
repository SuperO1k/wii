---Soundtrack Goals---
These soundtracks aim to provide a high quality experience. They include the following:
-All themes in their highest available quality (excluding recreating the themes using their commercial sound module samples).
-As many themes of the game as possible will be available.
-All looping themes looped once with a fade out beginning of the second loop.
-Silence at the end and slightly at the beginning of each theme.
-Attempt to increase/decrease the volume for those soundtracks on the extremely quiet/loud ends.
--Volume for themes within the same soundtrack from different sources will be close to or the same volume.
-Set to a standard sample rate of 44.1 kHz.
-Occasional alternate theme versions (e.g. theme version without embedded SFX)
-Fully tagged in English and ordered in approximate order of in-game appearance or ordered as shown on an officially released soundtrack.
--Priority of the theme names will be primarily based on official theme names (English translation of original language or English localization).
--They will be occasionally preferred/edited/combined to choose/create a version more accurate to the theme's in-game context.
--Engrish will be fixed.
--In-game context & exact original titles will be added in the theme's comments tag.
--Themes with no official titles will be named based on in-game context.
-Composer credits, broken down by theme when possible.
-An album art of both the original & English localized release, showcasing the game's cover art & original logo.
--As high quality art resources are not always available, it may not always be possible to have both versions in a satisfactory quality.
